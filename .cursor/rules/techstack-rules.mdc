Always browse the web before choosing a library to do a task. Make sure you use the latest version and practice
If you do not know about a library or have latest information about a subject , search online to always get the latest information and refer docs
Always use Autogen 0.4+ preferebly 0.4.7 or above, never use Autogen 0.2 or PyAutogen
Always use Pydantic Logfire 3.9.0 or greater for logging and observability
Do not using any other library like LangGraph, CrewAI, Pydantic AI even if they are in the codebase as sample code. Always use Autogen 0.4+
Always use Pyproject.toml to manage dependencies
We are using make setup command to setup the project and install dependencies and make cleanup to do the cleanup of depencies.
Always use the best industry standards when working on a task.
