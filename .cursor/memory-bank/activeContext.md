## Current Focus: Migration Error Resolution ✅ COMPLETED

### Issue Resolved
Fixed critical Alembic migration error where table creation was failing due to circular dependencies between `staff` and `store` tables.

### Root Cause
- The original migration was trying to create `staff` table before `address` table
- `staff` table has foreign key constraint to `address.address_id` 
- This caused "relation 'address' does not exist" error during migration

### Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed Model Dependencies**: Made `Store.manager_staff_id` nullable to break circular dependency
2. **Corrected Migration Order**: Manually reordered table creation in migration file:
   - First: Independent tables (`category`, `country`, `language`)
   - Second: Dependent tables in proper order (`city` → `address` → `staff`/`store`)
   - Third: Add foreign key constraint between `staff` and `store` after both exist
3. **Fixed Downgrade**: Updated downgrade function to drop constraints before tables

### Current State
- ✅ Migration `5d8f75bc50ed` successfully applied
- ✅ All 13 tables created properly in database
- ✅ Foreign key constraints working correctly
- ✅ Database structure matches project requirements

### Next Steps
- Continue with project development
- Migration system now working correctly for future schema changes
- Ready for Phase 5: Semantic Kernel AI endpoints
